This app was designed as a test of my knowledge of the course material in the University of Richmond Web Development Bootcamp. It is a full stack example of a simple app.
The app simply allows the user to add a string to the page, ostensibly as the name of a burger, and then click a button that changes the format around that string/burger name.

This was strictly a test of whether I could create a fullstack program including frontend html, css, and javascript as well as backend server via node.js, a custum ORM and mySQL database.
